              <p>     Ryan Rennie is a composer for video games and other media. He graduated from The Ohio State University in 2023 with a B.M. in Composition, where his works were performed live on multiple occasions. He seeks to incorporate elements of music from a variety of styles, including classical music, film and video game music, rock music, and more. In particular, he takes great inspiration from the works of Gustav Holst, Maurice Ravel, John Williams, Yuka Tsujiyoko, and Hiroyuki Sawano. Ryan always endeavors to refine his craft in a never-ending pursuit to acquire more knowledge and insight into the creation of music.</p>
              <p>     Currently, through independent instruction at ReelScoring, LLC, a company that specializes in media music composition and sound design, Ryan is advancing his education. Through this instruction, he has developed skills in audio engineering and gained a firm grasp on music technologies while broadening his expertise in a variety of mediums. He seeks to expand his network to obtain new opportunities and friends, and he works to further develop his portfolio to showcase his abilities. His recent projects have traversed beyond video game scoring, including composition for tabletop gaming and musical theater. He adopted the role of arranger, co-composer, and co-conductor for the 2023 musical The Picture of Dorian, based on the work of Oscar Wilde.</p>
              <p>     Ryanâ€™s goal is to expand his horizons by absorbing what is useful from all music he listens to while adding what is essentially his own. In doing so, there is a wide variety of effects and styles from which to choose, creating flexibility in scoring and interesting new possibilities. Ryan strives to always continue to learn; there is always room for growth.</p>
